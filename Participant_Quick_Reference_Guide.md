### KEY CONCEPTS TO REMEMBER

**1. Financial Independence Number (FIN)**
The amount you need saved to replace your paycheck
- Example: $90K/year income = ~$1.5M needed
- Calculate with 3% inflation
- Retirement is a NUMBER, not an age

**2. Defense vs. Offense**
- Defense = Paying down debt
- Offense = Investing money
- You need BOTH to win

**3. The Oxygen Mask Principle**
Put YOUR mask on first before helping others
- Secure YOUR retirement first
- Kids can borrow for college; you can't borrow for retirement
- Be a blessing, not a burden in retirement

**4. The Boiling Frog**
Inflation happens slowly — we adjust without noticing
- 40% of money supply printed in last 5 years
- Emergency fund turns emergencies into inconveniences

**5. The Golden Rule**
**AUTOMATE IT!** The moment you free up cash, auto-transfer it to:
- Debt payoff
- Investment account
- Emergency fund

### THE THREE PATHS

| Path | Time/Money Trade | Control | Taxes | Freedom |
|------|------------------|---------|-------|---------|
| **Employee** | Trade time for money | Someone else controls you | Crushed (35%+) | Paycheck to paycheck |
| **Self-Employed** | 80 hrs/week, same money | You control time | Better | Still trading time |
| **Business Owner** | Build systems once | Complete autonomy | 9% (S-Corp) | Passive income |

**Key:** "It's not what you make, it's what you keep."
