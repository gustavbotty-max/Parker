Subject: Quick thought — wanted to share this with you

Hey there — Jonathan here.

Next week I'm running a workshop called 21 Sources of Cash. I wanted to drop it in your inbox in case it resonates.

The whole idea is this: most of us are losing money every month without even realizing it. It could be buried in our taxes, insurance, debt payments, bank accounts — stuff we've just accepted as "normal." But there's usually $100–500+ per month hiding in there that could be freed up and redirected toward what actually matters to you.

I'm not trying to sell anything or convince you to buy a course. Honestly, I'm running this for a group I'm part of and thought a few more folks might get value from it. It's just a conversation about practical stuff — things I wish someone had walked me through years ago.

We'll cover:
• Freeing up cash you didn't know you had
• Ways to optimize what you're already doing
• Paying down debt faster or building savings
• Figuring out your own "financial independence number" (less scary than it sounds)

It's on Zoom, next week [INSERT DATE/TIME]. If it sounds useful, hop on. If not, no worries at all — just thought I'd share.

Let me know if you're interested and I'll send the link.

Cheers,
Jonathan

P.S. — This is based on a book/seminar from a guy named Ron Weber who's been in the advisory business 40+ years. Solid practical stuff, not theory.
