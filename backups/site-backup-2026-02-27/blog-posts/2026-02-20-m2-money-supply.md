# Why Your Savings Account Is Secretly Shrinking (And What M2 Has to Do With It)

Imagine you stashed $10,000 in a savings account back in 2020. You felt good about it. Safe, secure, responsible. Fast forward to today: that same account still shows $10,000 (plus a few dollars in interest), but here's the uncomfortable truth. It buys less. A lot less. Your grocery bill knows it. Your rent knows it. That money didn't go anywhere, but its power did. Welcome to the quiet erosion that happens when the money supply grows faster than the economy that has to absorb it.

## The Real Talk

### What Is M2, Anyway?

M2 sounds like a highway or a vitamin, but it's actually just a fancy term for most of the money sloshing around the U.S. economy. Think of it as three buckets combined into one big pile:

- **Cash and checking accounts** (the money you use every day)
- **Savings accounts** (your emergency fund, vacation savings, etc.)
- **Small CDs and money market funds** (short-term savings vehicles)

Add it all up, and you get about $22.4 trillion. That's trillion with a T. And that pile has grown by roughly 5.7% over the past year alone.

Here's the simplest way to think about it. Imagine the economy is a giant pizza. The money supply is the number of slices everyone is holding. When the Fed (that's our central bank) creates more money, they're essentially cutting the same pizza into more and more slices. Each slice gets smaller. That's inflation in a nutshell.

### The Pandemic Money Surge

Between 2020 and 2021, something unprecedented happened. The government pumped trillions of dollars into the economy to keep things afloat during COVID lockdowns. M2 grew by about 40% in less than two years. That's the fastest expansion in modern history.

Think about that for a second. In roughly 18 months, we created 40% more money. The pizza didn't get bigger. We just kept cutting it into smaller pieces. Then in 2022, inflation hit 9.1%. Surprise? Not really. More money chasing the same goods always ends the same way.

### Why Inflation Is "Only" 2.4% Now

So if M2 grew 40% and keeps growing, why isn't inflation still raging? Here's where it gets interesting.

The economy has a hidden dial called "velocity," and right now, that dial is turned way down. Velocity measures how fast money changes hands. During the pandemic, people saved more and spent less. Money sat in accounts instead of circulating. It's like having a lot of water in a reservoir, but the dam is holding most of it back.

The risk? If that dam opens, if people start spending faster while all that money is still out there, inflation could tick back up. It's a slow burn situation. Your purchasing power is eroding gradually, like a shoreline washing away bit by bit.

## What This Means for Triangle Families

The Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area isn't just any market. We're one of the fastest-growing regions in the country. That growth brings opportunity, but it also means we're feeling these national trends more acutely.

When M2 expands nationally and thousands of new people move here simultaneously, you get a double squeeze. More money plus more demand equals higher prices. Your rent went up. Your home value probably went up too. That's not coincidence. That's monetary policy meeting local reality.

Here's the math that matters. North Carolina saw unemployment drop in 99 of 100 counties last December. That's fantastic. But it also means more people have paychecks to spend, which keeps local demand strong. Combine that with housing shortages and national money supply growth, and the pressure on prices isn't going anywhere.

If you're keeping $50,000 in savings for emergencies or a down payment, at 2.4% inflation, you're losing about $1,200 in purchasing power every single year. And that's assuming inflation stays tame.

## Your Next Move

You can't control the Federal Reserve. But you can control how you respond.

**Audit your cash position.** If you have more than six months of expenses sitting in a standard savings account earning 0.5% while inflation runs 2.4%, you're going backward. Look at high-yield savings accounts, Treasury I Bonds (for money you won't touch for a year), or other inflation-protected options. Protect your emergency fund from becoming an erosion fund.

**Watch your housing math.** Whether you're renting or own, factor in sustained price pressure. Triangle growth isn't slowing, and neither is monetary expansion. If you're waiting to buy "until prices drop," you might be waiting a while. If you're a homeowner, your asset is appreciating, which helps offset inflation elsewhere in your budget.

**Stay informed, not alarmed.** Check CPI reports monthly. Watch what the Fed says about interest rates. Knowledge is the best defense against gradual wealth erosion. When you see inflation numbers, ask yourself: Is my income and my savings keeping pace?

Your money works hard for you. Make sure it isn't working harder for inflation.
