# The K-Shaped Recovery: Why Your Neighbor's Economy Looks Nothing Like Yours

You and your coworker both kept your jobs through the pandemic. You both shop at the same Harris Teeter, your kids go to similar schools, and you both complain about I-40 traffic. But somehow, they just bought a bigger house in Apex while you're wondering if you can afford to renew your lease in Cary. What gives?

## Here's What Actually Matters

We keep hearing that North Carolina was named "State of the Year for Economic Development" and that Raleigh's unemployment dropped to 3%—the lowest in the state. The headlines say "recovery." But recovery for whom?

Here's the uncomfortable truth: We're living through what's called a **K-shaped recovery**. Picture the letter K. Two arms diverging from the same starting point, heading in completely different directions.

**The upper arm:** If you owned a home before 2020, you've probably watched your property value soar. If you work in tech, biotech, or any RTP-adjacent field, your wages have likely outpaced inflation. If you had investments, they've grown. You're feeling pretty good about things.

**The lower arm:** If you're renting, you've seen your monthly payment jump 30-40% since 2020. If you work in hospitality, retail, or mid-level administrative roles, your paycheck buys less now than it did five years ago, despite being employed the entire time.

Same economy. Completely different experiences.

## The Middle Is Getting Squeezed

Remember when "middle class" meant a single income could buy a starter home, save for retirement, and send kids to decent schools? That middle is hollowing out.

In the Triangle, families are sorting into two camps: those with dual professional incomes plus asset portfolios, and everyone else trying to keep up with rising costs on stagnant wages. The traditional middle (single-earner families, folks in manufacturing or administrative roles, younger workers without inherited wealth) is facing something new. You can be fully employed and still feel like you're falling behind.

Think of it like a canoe race where some people got motors halfway through. Everyone's paddling, but some are pulling ahead while others struggle against the current.

## What This Means for Triangle Families

Let's get local. The Triangle has some of the fastest population growth in the country. Companies are relocating here. Research Triangle Park keeps expanding. That's great for our region, and if you already owned property or work in high-demand fields, you're benefiting directly.

But that same growth drives up housing costs. It intensifies competition for apartments in Durham, townhomes in Raleigh, starter homes in Chapel Hill. The people pouring into our area for tech jobs are driving demand that raises costs for everyone else.

Raleigh's 3% unemployment sounds fantastic. And it is, if you're looking for a job. But it doesn't tell you whether that job pays enough to cover a $2,200 rent payment or whether it comes with benefits that protect your family. Being employed and being financially secure aren't the same thing anymore.

## Your Next Move

Here's what you can actually do about this:

**First, take an honest look at which arm of the K you're on.** Not to panic, just to plan. If your industry is facing wage pressure or automation risk, here's something to consider: we're entering the era of the solopreneur. AI tools have made it more attainable than ever to start a small business that brings real value to your community, and you can run it solo. Whether it's consulting in your current expertise, creating digital products, or offering specialized local services, you don't need to chase a tech job to build financial stability. Start small, solve a problem you see in the Triangle, and grow from there.

**Second, build a real safety net.** I know, "save more" feels impossible when everything costs more. But here's the thing. In a K-shaped economy, being employed doesn't guarantee security the way it used to. Aim for 6 months of expenses, minimum. If that feels overwhelming, start with one month and build from there.

**Third, protect what you have.** If you haven't reviewed your life and disability insurance in the past two years, do it now. Your coverage should match your current income, not what you made in 2019. And if your employer offers a 401(k) match, max it out—compound growth is how the upper arm of that K stays ahead.

The economy isn't going back to "normal." This split, this divergence. That's the new terrain. But once you see the shape of things, you can navigate it.
