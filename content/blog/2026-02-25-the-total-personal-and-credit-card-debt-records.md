# Credit Card Debt Just Hit a Record. Here's How to Think About Yours

Americans now owe $1.28 trillion on credit cards. That's trillion with a T.

If that number feels abstract, here's the personal version: the average household carries about $11,000 in credit card debt. At typical interest rates, that balance costs roughly $2,200 per year just in interest. Money that could go toward savings, a family vacation, or your kid's college fund.

This isn't about shame. Plenty of people end up with balances for completely understandable reasons: medical bills, car repairs, gaps between paychecks. The question isn't how you got here. It's what you do next.

## Why Balances Keep Climbing

Credit card debt is up 66% since early 2021. That's not because everyone suddenly got reckless. A few things happened at once.

Prices went up. Groceries, gas, rent, childcare. When your income doesn't stretch as far, the credit card fills the gap.

Rates went up too. The average credit card APR now sits around 20% to 24%. A balance that felt manageable at 15% becomes much heavier at 22%.

And savings got depleted. Many families burned through pandemic-era cushions. When the emergency fund runs dry, plastic becomes the backup plan.

The result? More households carrying larger balances at higher rates. That's the recipe for the record we just set.

## The Math That Matters

Here's how credit card interest works against you.

Say you owe $10,000 at 22% APR. If you make only the minimum payment (usually around 2% of the balance), you'll pay roughly $200 per month. Sounds manageable.

But at that pace, it takes over 30 years to pay off. And you'll pay more than $18,000 in interest on top of the original $10,000.

That's the trap. Minimum payments keep you current, but they don't get you out.

Paying even $50 or $100 extra per month changes the equation dramatically. That same $10,000 balance at $300 per month? Paid off in under 4 years, with about $3,500 in total interest.

The difference between minimum and aggressive payoff can be $15,000 or more. That's real money.

## Debt Consolidation: When It Helps and When It Doesn't

Personal loans for debt consolidation are hitting record numbers. The pitch is simple: trade your 22% credit card rate for a 10% to 12% personal loan. Lower rate, one payment, done.

For some households, this works beautifully. The math is better, and the fixed payment creates structure.

But there are traps.

If you consolidate and then run up the cards again, you've doubled your problem. Now you have the personal loan and fresh credit card balances.

Some consolidation loans stretch payments over 5 to 7 years. You might pay less per month but more in total interest over time. Always run the numbers both ways.

And watch for fees. Origination fees on personal loans can eat into the savings.

Consolidation is a tool, not a solution. It works when paired with a plan to stop adding new debt. Without that, it's just rearranging chairs.

## What This Means for Triangle Families

The Triangle's economy is strong, but that doesn't make anyone immune to these pressures. Housing costs here have risen faster than wages. Childcare is expensive. And the same inflation hitting everyone else hits here too.

The difference is opportunity. Good jobs exist here. Side income possibilities are real. And compared to some parts of the country, the path from underwater to stable is shorter.

But you have to take steps. Debt doesn't fix itself. Neither does hope.

Local resources exist. NC has credit counseling organizations, some nonprofit, that can help negotiate rates or create payment plans. Your employer might offer financial wellness programs you haven't looked into. Worth checking.

## A Different Way to Think About It

Instead of viewing debt as a moral failing, try thinking of it like a subscription you didn't mean to sign up for.

That $11,000 balance at 22%? You're paying about $200 per month for the privilege of owing money. That's a subscription to nothing.

Canceling that subscription means redirecting those payments toward the principal. Every dollar you put toward the balance is a dollar that stops generating interest.

It's not exciting. It doesn't feel like progress at first. But compound interest works in reverse too. As the balance shrinks, so does the interest, and your payments become more effective.

## Your Next Move

**Know your actual numbers.** Log into your accounts and write down each balance, rate, and minimum payment. You can't build a plan without knowing what you're working with.

**Pick one card to attack.** Either the smallest balance (for quick wins) or the highest rate (for maximum savings). Put every extra dollar there while paying minimums on the rest.

**Freeze the growth.** If you're still adding to balances each month, the first priority is breaking even. That might mean a hard look at your budget, but it stops the bleeding.
