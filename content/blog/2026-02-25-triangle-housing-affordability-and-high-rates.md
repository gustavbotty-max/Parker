# Triangle Housing in 2026: The Numbers Are Finally Moving in Your Favor

For the past few years, buying a home in the Triangle felt like chasing a moving target. Prices kept climbing. Rates kept rising. And every time you thought you were close, the math fell apart.

Something's shifting.

The numbers are starting to look a little friendlier. Not dramatically cheaper, but more workable. If you've been sitting on the sidelines, here's what's actually happening.

## The 30% Threshold

There's a rule of thumb in housing: try to keep your monthly payment under 30% of your income. Above that, you're stretched. Below that, you've got room to breathe.

For the first time since 2022, the typical Triangle home payment is dipping below that line. Current estimates put it around 29.3% of median income.

That doesn't mean houses are cheap. It means the combination of prices, rates, and incomes has shifted just enough to bring payments back into reach for more families.

## What's Driving the Change?

A few things are converging.

**Inventory is up.** More homes are hitting the market than we've seen in recent years. When supply increases, buyers have options. Sellers can't demand as much when there are three other houses on the same street.

**Prices are stabilizing.** The Triangle median sits around $389,100. That's still high compared to five years ago, but the runaway growth has slowed. Some neighborhoods are even seeing modest price drops.

**Rates are holding.** Mortgage rates hover near 6%. That's not the 3% we saw in 2021, but it's lower than the 7%+ spike in 2023. Predictability helps with planning, even if the number isn't ideal.

## New Housing Options Are Coming

Chapel Hill recently changed zoning rules to allow more duplexes and accessory dwelling units (ADUs). That's the small apartment above a garage or the converted basement with its own entrance.

Why does this matter? These "missing middle" housing types cost less to build and buy than single-family homes. They create options for people who don't need 2,500 square feet but want something better than a cramped apartment.

Other Triangle communities are watching. If these zoning changes work, expect similar moves in Raleigh, Durham, and surrounding towns. More housing types mean more price points, which means more families can find something that fits.

## The Rate Reality

Here's the honest truth about rates: 6% is not going away tomorrow.

The Fed's inflation fight isn't over. Rate cuts that analysts expected earlier this year keep getting pushed back. If you're waiting for 4% mortgages to return, you might be waiting a long time.

That doesn't mean you're stuck forever. But it does mean the calculation has changed. Instead of "wait for rates to drop," the question becomes "can I make the current numbers work?"

For some families, the answer is yes, especially with stabilizing prices and more inventory. For others, it might mean adjusting expectations: a smaller home, a different neighborhood, or building more down payment savings before jumping in.

## Running Your Own Numbers

Here's a quick way to check where you stand.

Take your gross monthly income (before taxes). Multiply by 0.28 to 0.30. That's a reasonable target for your housing payment, including principal, interest, taxes, and insurance.

If you earn $6,000 per month, aim for a payment around $1,680 to $1,800.

At 6% interest, that roughly supports a loan amount between $280,000 and $300,000. Add your down payment, and you've got your price range.

If the math doesn't work for the neighborhoods you're targeting, you have three levers: earn more, save a bigger down payment, or look at different areas. No magic, just arithmetic.

## What This Means for Triangle Families

The Triangle remains a destination. Tech jobs, universities, healthcare systems, and quality of life keep pulling people here. Long-term demand isn't going away.

But the market has cooled from its frenzy. Bidding wars are less common. Inspection contingencies are back. Sellers are more willing to negotiate.

If you've been priced out for the past few years, this is worth another look. Not because it's suddenly easy, but because the conditions are more balanced than they've been since before the pandemic.

## Your Next Move

**Get pre-approved now, even if you're not ready to buy.** A pre-approval letter shows you the real numbers, not estimates. It also positions you to move quickly when the right place appears.

**Look at emerging neighborhoods.** The hottest zip codes carry premium prices. Areas ten minutes further out often offer similar quality at lower cost. As the Triangle expands, today's "up and coming" becomes tomorrow's established.

**Explore down payment assistance.** NC has programs for first-time buyers and specific professions. A few thousand dollars in assistance can meaningfully shift what you can afford. Worth researching before assuming you're on your own.
