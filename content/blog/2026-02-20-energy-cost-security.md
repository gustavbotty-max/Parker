# Why Rising Energy Costs Belong in Your Financial Plan (And How to Optimize Them)

Your January electric bill probably got your attention. If you're a typical Duke Energy Progress customer using 1,000 kWh per month, it jumped from $163.84 to $186.95. That's $23.11 more every month, with another increase to $193.54 already scheduled for next year.

Duke has also filed for additional rate adjustments in 2027 and 2028.

This isn't a one-time spike. North Carolina electricity bills have climbed 22% since 2020, with state regulators projecting potential increases of 40-60% over the next 15 years as electricity demand grows and infrastructure requires investment.

## The Real Talk: Energy as a Portfolio Line Item

### Understanding the Trajectory

Most families treat utilities as a fixed cost they can't influence. The reality is more nuanced. Duke Energy forecasts net load growth of 16-60% over the next 15 years—significantly higher than the 7% growth seen over the previous two decades. This suggests the rate increases we've seen may continue.

The math matters for financial planning. If you were paying $150 per month in 2020, you're likely approaching $190-$200 now. That's $480-$600 more annually than three years ago, compounding yearly. Over a 10-year horizon, this becomes a meaningful line item in your household budget.

### The Cash Flow Impact

Energy costs typically rank as the third-largest expense for middle-class families, behind housing and food. Unlike discretionary spending, heating and cooling are non-negotiable—particularly for families with young children, elderly members, or health considerations.

When bills spike unpredictably (high summer AC usage, winter heating peaks), the ripple effects touch other financial priorities:
- Emergency fund contributions may get deferred
- Extra debt payments get paused
- Retirement contributions get reduced or skipped
- Credit card balances increase to bridge cash flow gaps

Financial planning involves controlling what you can control. While you can't shop for a different electricity provider in Duke's service territory, you can treat energy costs as an optimizable expense—similar to how you might evaluate insurance, refinancing, or tax strategy.

## What This Means for Triangle Families

**The Efficiency Multiplier Effect**

Duke Energy uses a tiered rate structure: lower rates for baseline usage, higher rates as consumption increases. This means conservation and efficiency improvements can yield outsized returns. A 20% reduction in consumption might produce a 25-30% reduction in your bill because you spend more time in those lower-rate tiers.

For a family paying $2,400 annually, a 25% reduction saves $600 per year. Over five years, that's $3,000—real money that can fund emergency savings, retirement contributions, or college accounts.

**The Investment Case for Efficiency**

Home energy improvements should be evaluated like any other investment: upfront cost, annual return, payback period, and risk-adjusted yield.

The federal Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit offers 30% of costs, up to $1,200 annually through 2032. This effectively reduces your basis and improves your return calculation. For a family planning to stay in their home 5+ years, efficiency improvements often pay for themselves through reduced bills, then continue generating savings.

Consider it similar to purchasing a bond that pays monthly dividends (lower bills) while also appreciating your home's value.

## Your Next Move: Four Financial Strategies

**1. Eliminate Predictability Risk with Budget Billing**

Duke Energy's budget billing program averages your annual consumption into 12 equal monthly payments. You pay more in mild months (spring/fall) and less in peak months (summer/winter), but your cash flow becomes predictable.

For households living on tight margins or timing multiple financial goals, predictability has real value. You can plan contributions to retirement accounts, 529 plans, or debt payoff around a known utility cost rather than guessing whether next month will be $140 or $280.

**2. Treat Efficiency Upgrades as Tax-Advantaged Investments**

The Inflation Reduction Act extended energy efficiency tax credits through 2032. Here's the financial breakdown:

- **30% federal tax credit** on qualifying improvements
- **Annual cap of $1,200** (resets each tax year)
- **Covered items**: Insulation, efficient windows/doors, upgraded HVAC systems, heat pumps

If you spend $4,000 on insulation and air sealing improvements, you receive a $1,200 tax credit. Your actual cost is $2,800. If those improvements reduce annual energy costs by $400, your payback period is 7 years. After that, you're earning $400 annually in perpetuity (or until the next efficiency improvement).

Compare that to current savings account yields, and it becomes an attractive use of capital.

**3. Build a Utility Buffer for Cash Flow Management**

Create a designated savings bucket holding 2-3 months of peak-season utility costs (roughly $500-$700 for most Triangle families). This isn't your emergency fund—it's a cash flow smoothing mechanism.

When July or January arrives with a $300+ bill, you draw from this buffer rather than:
- Carrying credit card debt at 18-24% APR
- Skipping retirement contributions that trigger employer matches
- Deferring extra principal payments on high-interest debt

Treat it as a revolving facility. You draw in peak months, replenish in mild months.

**4. Optimize Your Rate Plan**

Duke Energy offers time-of-use rates that charge different rates depending on when you use electricity. If your household can shift discretionary usage (laundry, dishwashing, EV charging) to off-peak hours, you may achieve meaningful savings without reducing total consumption.

This requires analysis of your specific usage patterns. Duke provides tools to compare your current plan against alternatives. The 15 minutes spent reviewing your options could yield ongoing savings.

## The Bottom Line

Rising energy costs are a financial reality for Triangle families. You can't control utility rate filings or infrastructure investment decisions, but you can control how you respond:

- **Smooth your cash flow** with budget billing
- **Earn 30% returns** through federal tax credits on efficiency investments
- **Build buffers** to protect other financial priorities from seasonal volatility
- **Optimize your rate plan** to match your usage patterns

Energy costs belong in your financial plan alongside mortgage rates, investment allocations, and tax strategy. With intentionality, you can turn a volatile expense into a predictable, optimizable line item—and redirect the savings toward building wealth instead of feeding the meter.
