# Inflation Isn't Done Yet. Here's How to Budget Around It

You know that feeling when you think you're finally getting ahead, and then the goalposts move?

That's what happened this week. Fresh inflation data came in higher than expected. Markets dropped. And those interest rate cuts everyone was hoping for? They just got pushed further out.

If you've been waiting for relief on your mortgage rate or credit card APR, you'll be waiting a bit longer. Here's what's actually going on and what it means for your household.

## The Numbers That Matter

The Fed watches something called Core PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) to track inflation. It jumped 0.4% in a single month, pushing the annual rate back up to 3.0%.

That doesn't sound dramatic until you remember the Fed wants to see 2.0% before cutting rates. We're still a full percentage point away.

Translation: borrowing costs stay elevated. If you've got a variable-rate loan, an adjustable mortgage, or credit card debt, don't expect relief soon.

## Tariffs Are Making Things Messier

On top of sticky inflation, new tariffs are kicking in on imported goods. The numbers being thrown around are 10% to 15% on a wide range of products.

Courts have been challenging some of these policies, creating uncertainty about what sticks and what gets reversed. That uncertainty itself causes problems, since businesses don't know how to price things and investors don't know where to put money.

What does this mean at the checkout line? Imported goods get more expensive. Electronics, clothing, certain foods, auto parts. Anything with components from overseas could see price bumps in the coming months.

## What About Interest Rates?

Earlier this year, analysts expected rate cuts by mid-2026. That outlook has shifted.

With inflation running hot and trade policy adding pressure, the Fed has less room to ease. Some forecasters now wonder if rates stay high through the end of the year, or even tick up slightly.

For families carrying debt, this changes the math. That mortgage refinance you've been eyeing? The rate might not drop enough to justify the closing costs. That car loan you're planning? Budget for current rates, not hoped-for cuts.

## How Stagflation Worries Affect You

There's a term floating around in financial news: stagflation. It describes a situation where prices keep rising while the economy slows down. High inflation plus weak growth equals a tough environment for everyone.

We're not there yet. But the combination of persistent inflation and uncertain trade policy has people paying attention.

If stagflation takes hold, it creates a squeeze. Your paycheck buys less while job growth slows. It's the worst of both worlds.

The practical response? Don't panic, but do plan. Households that stay flexible weather these periods better than those locked into assumptions that don't play out.

## What This Means for Triangle Families

The Triangle's economy is diverse, which helps. Tech, healthcare, education, and government jobs provide some cushion against manufacturing-heavy downturns.

But you still buy groceries. You still fill up the car. You still pay rent or a mortgage. When import costs rise and interest rates stay high, everyone feels it.

Housing remains the big one. Triangle home prices haven't dropped significantly, and mortgage rates near 7% make affordability tough. If you're waiting to buy, you might be waiting a while longer. If you already own, your locked-in rate is looking pretty good right now.

For renters, higher borrowing costs often translate to landlords passing costs through. Budget for rent increases when your lease renews.

## Your Next Move

**Reassess your debt payoff timeline.** If you've been making minimum payments expecting rates to drop, consider accelerating. High rates reward aggressive debt reduction. Every dollar you pay down at 20% APR saves you 20 cents per year in interest.

**Build buffer into your monthly budget.** Price increases on everyday goods may hit faster than wage increases. Padding your grocery and household budget by 5% to 10% gives you breathing room without scrambling.

**Hold off on rate-dependent decisions.** Refinancing, major purchases with financing, or anything that requires a specific rate environment might be worth delaying until the picture clears. If you can wait six months, you'll have better information.
