## Deep Dive: Retirement Planning Trends
Retirement planning in 2026 is evolving with the implementation of SECURE 2.0 Act provisions, allowing higher catch-up contributions and mandating qualified longevity annuity contracts for certain plans. This aims to extend retirement savings, but wealth inequality persists, with some households facing inadequate coverage and rising health costs. Medicare Advantage premiums are projected to fall by $2.40 monthly to $14.00, while Part D plans average $34.50, providing slight relief for middle-class retirees.

Trends highlight a shift toward personalized, tech-driven planning, with younger workers experiencing financial stress prompting earlier interventions. Long-term care costs and life expectancy increases underscore the need for diversified strategies beyond traditional 401(k)s. Tax-efficient moves like Roth conversions offer opportunities for middle-income families to optimize withdrawals.

For NC Triangle families, these changes mean reevaluating open enrollment benefits, comparing plans, and addressing life events that trigger updates. Proactive steps can mitigate risks from market volatility and ensure sustainable income in later years.
