## Deep Dive: The Total Personal and Credit Card Debt Records
In 2026, U.S. credit card debt has reached a record $1.28 trillion, according to the New York Fed, marking a 66% increase from the $770 billion low in Q1 2021. This surge reflects reliance on credit amid high living costs, with average household balances at $11,019, just $2,065 below the all-time high. Delinquencies are also rising, indicating broader financial pressure on consumers.

Personal loan originations have hit records for the second consecutive quarter in Q3 2025, often used for debt consolidation to escape high credit card rates. While this can help some households, it may not suit everyone, as new loans could extend repayment periods. For middle-class families in the NC Triangle, these trends highlight the need for careful debt management to protect savings and retirement goals.

Overall, escalating debt levels underscore the importance of budgeting and seeking low-interest alternatives to prevent long-term financial strain.

- Consider consolidation if rates are lower; compare personal loan options carefully.
- Build emergency funds; reduce reliance on credit for unexpected expenses.
- Monitor delinquency trends; early intervention can prevent credit score damage.
- Consult financial advisors; NC-specific programs may offer debt relief resources.
