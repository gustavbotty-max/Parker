## Deep Dive: Triangle Housing Affordability and High Rates
In 2026, the NC Triangle housing market is seeing modest improvements in affordability despite persistent high mortgage rates around 6%. Home prices are expected to drop in certain areas, with the typical monthly payment slipping to 29.3% of median income, marking the first time under 30% since 2022. This stabilization is driven by increasing inventory and lower rates, though long-term demand from tech sector growth and universities in Raleigh-Durham sustains prices around $389,100.

Local initiatives, such as zoning changes in Chapel Hill to allow more "missing middle" housing like duplexes and accessory dwelling units (ADUs), aim to boost supply and reduce cost pressures. Projects like mixed-income developments in Charlotte highlight efforts to blend affordable and market-rate options. However, high rates continue to challenge buyers, potentially delaying purchases for middle-class families balancing education and retirement goals.

For Triangle residents, these trends offer hope for better access to housing, but proactive planning is essential to navigate the high-rate environment.

## Actionable Insights
- Monitor local price drops; target areas with expected declines for better deals.
- Explore new zoning options; duplexes and ADUs could provide affordable entry points.
- Calculate affordability; aim for payments under 30% of income for sustainable homeownership.
- Watch inventory increases; more options may emerge despite high rates.
- Consult local experts; NC-specific programs could assist with down payments or rates.
