## Deep Dive: The Energy Cost Squeeze on Triangle Families

**The Rate Hike Spiral**

Duke Energy isn't just asking for one rate increase. They've filed for hikes in 2027 and 2028 on top of the increases already approved through 2026. For a typical Duke Energy Progress residential customer using 1,000 kWh per month, that means bills jumping from $163.84 to $186.95 (a $23.11 increase), then climbing another $6.59 to $193.54 just one year later.

The broader picture is even more concerning. North Carolina electricity bills have climbed 22% since 2020, and state energy regulators warn they could rise 40-60% over the next 15 years. Duke Energy forecasts net load increases between 16% and 60% over the next decade and a half—compared to just 7% growth over the previous two decades. That's a massive acceleration in demand and infrastructure costs that will flow directly to residential bills.

**The Financial Security Impact**

For middle-class Triangle families, this isn't a minor budget adjustment. It's a fundamental shift in household economics. A family paying $150/month in 2020 now faces bills approaching $190-$200—and that's before the 2027-2028 increases hit. Over a year, that's $600+ in additional costs, every year, compounding.

The timing is brutal. These increases hit while families are already navigating high housing costs in Raleigh-Durham, elevated grocery prices, and stagnant wage growth in many sectors. The energy burden (percentage of income spent on utilities) is rising precisely when families have the least slack in their budgets.

Unlike discretionary spending, heating and cooling are non-negotiable—especially for families with young children, elderly members, or health conditions. When bills spike unexpectedly, the cascade is predictable: credit card balances increase, emergency funds get skipped, retirement contributions pause, and financial stress compounds.

**What's Driving These Increases**

Duke Energy cites several factors: aging infrastructure requiring upgrades, new power generation needs to meet growing demand, grid modernization for reliability, and the transition to cleaner energy sources. The utility is also dealing with higher costs for fuel and purchased power.

Critics point to disconnections soaring even as Duke seeks higher rates and profits. The tension between utility financial health and household affordability is sharpening—and regulators at the NC Utilities Commission will hold public hearings where customers can voice concerns before decisions are made.

## Actionable Insights

- **Speak Up at Public Hearings**: The NCUC holds public hearings on rate requests. Customers can attend and provide written comments. Your voice matters in this process.

- **Get a Free Home Energy Assessment**: Duke Energy offers free home energy audits that identify waste and efficiency opportunities. Most homes lose significant heated/cooled air through ductwork and poor insulation—fixes that directly reduce consumption.

- **Switch to Budget Billing**: Duke's budget billing program averages annual costs into 12 equal payments, eliminating seasonal shock and making cash flow predictable. Essential for families on tight margins.

- **Capture Federal Tax Credits**: The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit covers 30% of costs (up to $1,200 annually) for insulation, windows, doors, and HVAC upgrades. For families planning to stay in their homes 5+ years, these improvements pay for themselves through reduced bills.

- **Build a Utility Buffer**: Create a separate savings bucket with 2-3 months of peak-season utility costs. When extreme weather hits, pull from this buffer instead of carrying credit card debt.
