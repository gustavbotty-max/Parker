## Deep Dive: College Savings/FAFSA Updates
The 2026-27 FAFSA cycle brings significant updates following the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, with emergency revisions aimed at streamlining the application process for better accessibility. These changes, approved in the Federal Register, promise to reduce complexity for families, potentially increasing eligibility for grants and scholarships. However, the phasing out of the SAVE repayment plan by July 2028 may lead to higher default rates, as borrowers face stricter terms without this income-driven option.

Federal loan updates emphasize extended repayment plans and transitions from older models like PAYE and ICR, encouraging proactive management of debt. Campus-level pressures from declining international enrollment are prompting colleges to enhance default prevention, which could influence how aid is distributed. For NC Triangle families, these trends mean opportunities for more equitable financial aid but also the need to adapt to evolving policies.

Overall, while reforms aim to make college more affordable, middle-class households should prepare for potential increases in loan burdens. Balancing savings accounts like 529 plans with updated FAFSA strategies will be key to funding education without excessive debt.

## Actionable Insights

- Assess student loan repayment plans; transition away from SAVE before deadlines to avoid penalties.
- Contribute to 529 plans; tax advantages remain strong for college savings.
- Monitor NC-specific scholarships; state programs may align with federal changes.
- Consult financial aid offices; updates could affect expected family contributions.
