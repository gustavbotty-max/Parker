## Headlines Worth Watching

### 1. Federal Reserve Holds Interest Rates Steady
**Why it matters to Triangle families:** After a period of aggressive rate hikes, the Fed's pause gives families breathing room. Mortgage rates in the Raleigh-Durham area have stabilized around 6.5-7%, making homebuying slightly more predictable for NC Triangle residents. First-time buyers should keep an eye on spring inventory.

### 2. 529 College Savings Plan Changes Take Effect
**Why it matters:** New federal rules allow unused 529 funds to roll into Roth IRAs starting this year—up to $35,000 lifetime. This is huge for NC parents who worry about over-saving for college. Triangle families can now fund education without the "use it or lose it" anxiety.

### 3. NC State Health Plan Premium Updates
**Why it matters:** State employees and teachers in the Triangle should review their 2025 coverage. Open enrollment periods are closing soon, and plan changes could impact family budgets significantly.

### 4. Social Security COLA 2025: 2.5% Increase
**Why it matters:** Retirees in the Triangle see modest benefit increases. While helpful, many seniors still face gaps between Social Security and living costs—especially with Raleigh's rising housing prices.

### 5. IRS Delays 1099-K Reporting Threshold (Again)
**Why it matters:** Side hustlers and gig workers won't receive 1099-K forms for 2024 unless they exceed $20,000 AND 200 transactions. Good news for Triangle entrepreneurs doing small-scale selling online.

## Deep Dive: The Middle-Class Squeeze in 2025

Middle-class families in the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill corridor face a unique financial landscape this year. While the Triangle continues to attract high-paying tech and biotech jobs, cost-of-living pressures persist.

**Housing remains the headline story.** Median home prices in Raleigh hover around $450K—up significantly from pre-pandemic levels but down from 2022 peaks. Renters face similar pressure, with average two-bedroom apartments exceeding $1,800/month in prime areas.

**Insurance costs are climbing.** Homeowners in NC have seen property insurance premiums jump 15-25% over two years, partly due to hurricane risk reassessment. Auto insurance follows similar trends. For families already stretched thin, these "invisible" increases eat into savings potential.

**The silver lining?** Wage growth in tech-heavy Triangle markets has outpaced national averages. Families with dual incomes in professional roles have more flexibility—but single-income households and those in service industries feel the pinch acutely.

**What to watch:** NC legislators are discussing property tax relief measures this session. Any changes could meaningfully impact family budgets—especially for homeowners in rapidly appreciating Wake County neighborhoods.

## Actionable Insights

1. **Review your 529 plans** – If you've over-funded education savings, the new Roth IRA rollover option provides flexibility. Consult a financial professional about optimal funding levels.

2. **Shop homeowners insurance** – NC's competitive market means you might find better rates despite industry-wide increases. Get 2-3 quotes before your renewal.

3. **Check withholding** – The 2025 tax brackets adjusted for inflation. Use the IRS withholding estimator to avoid surprises next April.

4. **Emergency fund priority** – With economic uncertainty lingering, 3-6 months of expenses remains critical. High-yield savings accounts (4-5% APY) make this more achievable.

5. **Life insurance review** – If you bought term life 5+ years ago, your needs may have changed. Growing families in the Triangle should ensure coverage matches current obligations (mortgage, college, income replacement).
