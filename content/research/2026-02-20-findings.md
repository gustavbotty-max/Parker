## Headlines Worth Watching

- **M2 Money Supply Reaches $22.4 Trillion**: M2 has grown approximately 5.7% over the past year, continuing a steady expansion that Triangle families should monitor for inflation implications.
- **CPI Holds at 2.4% Year-Over-Year**: January 2026 inflation data shows modest price increases, but still above the Fed's 2% target—meaning purchasing power continues to erode for local families.
- **North Carolina Economic Growth Remains Strong**: With $43 million in new rural investments announced and film production spending at $185.5 million in 2025, the Triangle area continues to see economic activity that could amplify money supply effects on local prices.

## Deep Dive: The M2 Money Supply

**What Is M2 and Why Does It Matter?**

M2 is a broad measure of the money supply that includes everything in M1 (physical currency, checking accounts, and other liquid deposits) plus savings accounts, small-denomination time deposits (CDs under $100,000), and retail money market funds. Think of it as "cash plus money you can fairly quickly turn into cash."

The Federal Reserve tracks three main money supply categories:
- **M0 (Monetary Base)**: Physical currency plus bank reserves held at the Fed (~$5.4 trillion)
- **M1**: Currency in circulation plus checking/demand deposits (~$19.1 trillion)  
- **M2**: M1 plus savings, small CDs, and retail money market funds (~$22.4 trillion)

**Current Trends and Post-Pandemic Context**

As of December 2025, M2 stands at approximately $22.4 trillion, up from $21.2 trillion in August 2024—a growth rate of roughly 5.7% annually. This follows the dramatic expansion during 2020-2021 when the Fed injected trillions into the economy to combat pandemic effects. M2 grew by roughly 40% from early 2020 to late 2021, the fastest increase in modern history.

While growth has normalized, the money supply remains significantly larger than pre-pandemic levels. M2 velocity—the rate at which money changes hands in the economy—has remained historically low, which has helped contain inflation despite the massive monetary expansion. When velocity is low, each dollar supports fewer transactions, dampening inflationary pressure. However, if velocity increases while M2 remains elevated, inflation could accelerate.

**The Inflation Connection**

The relationship between M2 growth and inflation is straightforward in theory: more money chasing the same amount of goods leads to higher prices. The 2020-2021 M2 surge preceded the 2022 inflation spike that reached 9.1% (June 2022). Current inflation at 2.4% suggests the economy is absorbing the expanded money supply, but families are still experiencing gradual purchasing power erosion.

Historical parallels are instructive. Rapid M2 growth preceded inflationary periods in the 1970s (leading to stagflation) and has been associated with currency devaluation in numerous international cases. While the U.S. dollar's reserve currency status provides insulation, sustained M2 growth above economic output growth typically results in some form of price adjustment—whether in consumer prices, asset prices, or both.

## What This Means for Triangle Families

**Cost of Living Impact**

The Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area has experienced significant population growth and economic expansion, making it particularly susceptible to the interaction of broad money supply growth and local demand. Housing costs, a major component of family budgets, have risen substantially as the area attracts new residents and businesses. When M2 expands nationally while local demand surges, price pressures intensify.

**Savings and Purchasing Power**

Middle-class families with savings in traditional bank accounts are particularly affected. With M2 growing at 5.7% and CPI at 2.4%, there's a gap suggesting either latent inflation pressure or money flowing into asset markets rather than consumer goods. Either way, cash held in low-yield accounts is losing purchasing power. A family with $50,000 in savings is seeing its real value erode by approximately $1,200 annually at current inflation rates—and potentially more if broader M2 growth eventually translates to higher consumer prices.

**Local Economic Context**

North Carolina's strong economic performance—with unemployment decreasing in 99 of 100 counties in December 2025—means Triangle families have income opportunities that may offset inflation effects. However, this same strength can amplify money supply impacts as increased local spending meets constrained housing supply and service capacity.

## Actionable Insights

- **Understand Your Real Return**: If your savings account yields less than 2.4%, you're losing purchasing power. Consider Treasury I Bonds, high-yield savings accounts, or other inflation-protected options for emergency funds.

- **Monitor Housing Costs**: The Triangle's growth combined with national monetary expansion creates sustained upward pressure on housing. Families planning to buy should factor in continued price appreciation, while current homeowners benefit from asset appreciation that partially offsets inflation elsewhere.

- **Watch Velocity Signals**: If economic activity accelerates (higher velocity) while M2 remains elevated, inflation could tick upward. Monitor monthly CPI reports and Fed policy statements for early warning signs.

- **Diversify Beyond Cash**: Given sustained M2 growth, maintaining substantial wealth purely in cash or cash-equivalents exposes families to gradual wealth erosion. This is educational context—not investment advice—but understanding inflation's impact on cash holdings is crucial for long-term financial planning.

- **Local Opportunity Awareness**: North Carolina's economic momentum means wage growth may offset inflation for many workers. Stay informed about local employment trends and skill development opportunities that can enhance earning power faster than inflation erodes it.
