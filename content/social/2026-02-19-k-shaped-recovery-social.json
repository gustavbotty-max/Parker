But somehow, they just bought a bigger house in Apex while you're wondering about renewing your Cary lease. What gives?\n\nHere's the uncomfortable truth: We're living through a K-shaped recovery.\n\nThe upper arm: Homeowners have watched property values soar. Tech/biotech workers have seen wages outpace inflation. Investors have grown their portfolios. Life is good.\n\nThe lower arm: Renters face 30-40% payment jumps. Hospitality, retail, and admin workers earn less purchasing power than five years ago—despite being employed.\n\nSame economy. Completely different experiences.\n\nRaleigh's 3% unemployment sounds fantastic (and it is if you're job hunting). But that doesn't mean the job pays enough to cover $2,200 rent. Being employed and being financially secure aren't the same thing anymore.\n\nSo here's my question for Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill families: Which arm of the K are you on? And more importantly—what's your plan to move up if you need to?\n\nSometimes the first step is just knowing where you stand. I've built a calculator that can help you assess your current financial protection and see where you might have gaps.",

      "content": "Raleigh's unemployment is 3%—the lowest in NC. Great news, right?\n\nBut here's what the headline won't tell you: Employed ≠ Financially secure.\n\nSome households are riding the upper arm of the K: home values ↑, wages outpacing inflation, portfolio growth\n\nOthers are stuck on the lower arm: rents up 30-40%, stagnant wages, same job less purchasing power\n\nThe middle class is hollowing out. You can work full-time and still feel like you're drowning.",

        "The Triangle's growth story is real—tech moving in, RTP expanding, population booming.\n\nBut that same growth drives housing costs up for everyone. The people relocating for high-paying jobs create demand that prices out folks already here.",
        "If you're renting in Durham, working retail in Raleigh, or in mid-level admin in Chapel Hill—your paycheck buys LESS now than in 2019. Despite working the whole time.\n\nMeanwhile, homeowners have gained massive equity.\n\nThat's the K-shaped recovery in action.",
        "So what's the move?\n\n→ Take an honest look at which arm you're on\n→ Build a real safety net (6 months min)\n→ Protect what you have (review your insurance ASAP)\n→ Max out 401(k) matches (compound growth matters)\n\nThe economy won't go back to 'normal.' Navigate the terrain you've got.",

      "content": "Here's what I'm seeing in our local economy—and it doesn't match the headlines.\n\nNorth Carolina was just named 'State of the Year for Economic Development.' Raleigh's unemployment sits at 3%, the lowest in the state. The recovery, by most measures, looks robust.\n\nBut talk to working families in the Triangle and you'll hear a different story.\n\nWe're experiencing what economists call a K-shaped recovery: two diverging paths from the same starting point. The upper arm—property owners, tech/biotech professionals, those with investment portfolios—are seeing wages outpace inflation and assets appreciate significantly. The lower arm—renters, hospitality and retail workers, mid-level administrative staff—are watching their purchasing power erode despite remaining fully employed.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth: Being employed no longer guarantees financial security. Raleigh's 3% unemployment rate is genuinely good news for job seekers. But it doesn't tell us whether those jobs provide enough income to cover a $2,200 rent payment or offer benefits that protect against unexpected setbacks.\n\nFor Triangle families navigating this environment, three realities matter:\n\nFirst, understand which trajectory you're actually on—not to create anxiety, but to inform strategy. If your industry faces wage pressure or automation risk, now is the time to explore reskilling through community colleges or RTP workforce programs.\n\nSecond, reframe 'emergency savings.' In a K-shaped economy, employment itself is less stable as a foundation. The historical 3-month buffer is no longer sufficient; 6 months of expenses has become the practical minimum.\n\nThird, protective strategies need updating. Life and disability coverage should reflect current income, not 2019 levels. If you haven't reviewed policies recently, the coverage gaps may be significant.\n\nThe economy isn't returning to its previous structure. This divergence is the new baseline. But once we recognize the shape of things, we can plan accordingly.",
