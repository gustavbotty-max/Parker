        "1/ Budget billing. Duke averages your annual usage into 12 equal payments. Predictable cash flow beats surprise $280 summer bills when you're trying to fund your Roth IRA.",
        "2/ Federal tax credits. 30% of efficiency upgrade costs, up to $1,200/year through 2032. Insulation, windows, HVAC. If improvements save $400/year and cost $2,800 after credit, that's a 7-year payback—then $400/year forever.",
        "3/ Free energy audit. Duke will find where you're losing money (usually ductwork = 20-30% loss). No cost, high ROI information.",
        "4/ Utility buffer fund. 2-3 months of peak bills set aside. Draw in July/January, replenish in spring/fall. Protects your emergency fund and retirement contributions from seasonal volatility.",
        "Energy costs are the 3rd biggest expense for most families. Treat them like the portfolio line item they are—optimizable, predictable, and worthy of a financial strategy."

      "content": "Here's a financial planning angle many Triangle families overlook: energy costs deserve the same analytical attention as investment allocations or tax strategy.\n\nThe numbers:\n• Duke Progress bills: $163.84 → $186.95 (current), $193.54 (next year)\n• NC bills up 22% since 2020\n• Projected 40-60% increases over 15 years\n\nYou can't control utility rate filings. But you can control your response—and treat this as an optimizable expense rather than a fixed cost.\n\nFour strategies I'm discussing with clients:\n\n1. Budget billing for cash flow predictability. Equal monthly payments smooth the seasonal volatility that derails other financial priorities.\n\n2. Federal tax credits as investment returns. The 30% credit (up to $1,200/year) on efficiency improvements changes the ROI calculation significantly. A $4,000 insulation project becomes $2,800 after credit. At $400/year savings, that's a 7-year payback—attractive compared to current yields.\n\n3. Utility buffers for cash flow management. A designated $500-700 buffer for peak months prevents drawing from emergency funds or carrying credit card debt.\n\n4. Rate plan optimization. Time-of-use rates may reward households that can shift discretionary usage to off-peak hours. Worth the 15-minute analysis.\n\nThe families who stay on track financially treat every significant expense as optimizable. Energy costs included.\n\nWhat's your approach to managing utility volatility?",
