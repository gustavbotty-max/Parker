That's like cutting the same pizza into smaller and smaller slices. Even though inflation is \"only\" 2.4% now, your purchasing power is quietly eroding year after year.\n\nIf you have $50,000 sitting in a regular savings account at 0.5% interest, you're losing about $1,200 in buying power every single year. Your grocery bill knows it. Your rent definitely knows it.\n\nThe good news? You can do something about it. High-yield savings accounts, Treasury I Bonds, and staying informed about your cash position can help protect what you've worked so hard to build.\n\n👉 Here's the full breakdown: https://gustavbotty-max.github.io/Parker/blog-posts/m2-money-supply.html\n\n💬 Triangle friends—have you noticed your purchasing power being squeezed?

      "post": "Here's what I'm seeing with inflation and savings right now—and why your emergency fund might actually be an erosion fund.\n\nMost people don't know about M2. It's the total money supply in the economy: cash, checking accounts, savings, and short-term CDs. Add it all up and you're looking at $22.4 trillion. And it's growing fast—about 5.7% in the past year alone.\n\nHere's the issue nobody talks about:\n\nIf you're keeping significant cash in a standard savings account earning 0.5% while inflation runs 2.4%, you're not preserving wealth. You're losing it. Quietly. Relentlessly. About $1,200 per year in lost purchasing power for every $50,000 sitting idle.\n\nThe pandemic money surge (40% M2 growth in under 2 years) already hit us with 9.1% inflation in 2022. Today, money velocity is low—people are saving, not spending. But that dam could break. If spending accelerates while all this money remains in circulation, inflation pressures return.\n\nWhat I'm telling clients:\n\n→ Audit your cash position. More than 6 months of expenses in a low-yield account? You're going backward.\n\n→ Explore high-yield savings accounts and Treasury I Bonds for funds you won't need immediately.\n\n→ Stay informed. Watch CPI reports and Fed commentary. Knowledge is your best defense against gradual wealth erosion.\n\nThe economy isn't going to stop changing. Your strategy shouldn't either.\n\nWhat's your approach to protecting cash from inflation? I'd love to hear what's working for you—or what questions you have.\n\n📊 Full analysis: https://gustavbotty-max.github.io/Parker/blog-posts/m2-money-supply.html\n\n💰 Check your coverage: https://gustavbotty-max.github.io/Parker/insurance-calculator.html\n\n📅 Let's talk strategy: https://calendly.com/jonathan-parker-primerica\n\n#FinancialPlanning #Inflation #PersonalFinance #WealthManagement #MoneyManagement #FinancialEducation",
