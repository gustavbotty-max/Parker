        <h1>Your "Diversified" Index Fund Might Not Be as Diversified as You Think</h1>
        <div class="blog-meta">📅 February 27, 2026 · ⏱️ 5 min read · 📊 Investing & Diversification</div>

        <p>You've heard the advice a thousand times: just buy an S&P 500 index fund and hold it forever. It's 500 companies. That's diversification, right?</p>
        <p>Sort of. But maybe less than you'd expect.</p>
        <p>Here's what's actually happening inside that fund, and why it matters for your retirement account.</p>

        <h2>Seven Companies Run the Show</h2>
        <p>The "Magnificent Seven" (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, NVIDIA, Meta, and Tesla) now make up roughly <strong>35% to 40%</strong> of the entire S&P 500's value.</p>
        <p>Read that again. Seven companies out of 500 control more than a third of the index.</p>
        <p>When you buy VOO, SPY, or any fund tracking the S&P 500, you're not getting equal slices of 500 businesses. You're getting a big helping of seven tech giants and much smaller portions of everything else.</p>
        <p>That concentration has worked beautifully when those seven stocks go up. It becomes a problem when they don't.</p>

        <h2>What Happens When Tech Stumbles</h2>
        <p>Earlier this year, we got a preview. The Mag 7 dropped 6.3% while the rest of the S&P 500 barely moved (down just 0.1%).</p>
        <p>If you owned a broad index fund during that period, your balance dropped almost as much as if you'd owned only tech stocks. The "diversification" didn't protect you because the fund was already so heavily weighted toward those seven names.</p>
        <p>This isn't a prediction that tech will crash. It's a reminder that <strong>concentration works both ways</strong>. The same weighting that boosted returns on the way up amplifies losses on the way down.</p>

        <h2>How Index Funds Actually Work</h2>
        <p>The S&P 500 is "market-cap weighted." That means bigger companies get bigger slices of the pie.</p>
        <p>Apple is worth around $3 trillion. A small utility company might be worth $10 billion. In a market-cap weighted index, Apple gets 300 times more influence on the fund's performance than that utility.</p>
        <p>When you buy VOO or SPY, you're buying this exact weighting. About 35% tech, 13% financials, 11% communications. The other sectors divide what's left.</p>
        <p>This isn't a flaw in the fund. It's just how the index is built. But it does mean <strong>"owning the whole market" doesn't mean "owning everything equally."</strong></p>

        <h2>Equal-Weight Alternatives</h2>
        <p>Some funds take a different approach. Equal-weight S&P 500 funds (like RSP) give each company roughly the same allocation. The 500th-largest company matters just as much as the 1st.</p>
        <p>The tradeoff? When mega-caps surge, equal-weight funds lag. When mega-caps struggle, equal-weight funds hold up better.</p>
        <p>Neither approach is right or wrong. They're different bets on what will happen next.</p>
        <p>If you believe the biggest companies will keep getting bigger, market-cap weighting rewards that. If you think smaller companies might catch up (or big tech might stumble), equal-weight spreads the risk.</p>

        <h2>What This Means for Triangle Families</h2>
        <p>If your 401(k) default is an S&P 500 fund, you probably have significant tech exposure whether you chose it or not.</p>
        <p>For someone with 30 years until retirement, that concentration might be fine. You'll ride out the ups and downs. Time smooths volatility.</p>
        <p>For someone <strong>5 to 10 years from retirement</strong>, the math changes. A big tech correction right before you need the money could meaningfully impact your plans.</p>
        <p>This isn't about panic. It's about knowing what you own.</p>
        <p>Many employer plans offer options beyond the basic S&P 500 fund: international funds, bond funds, small-cap funds, sector-specific options. Understanding your current allocation helps you decide if adjustments make sense.</p>

        <h2>Running Your Own Check</h2>
        <p>Here's a quick way to assess your exposure:</p>
        <p><strong>Log into your retirement account.</strong> Look at your holdings. If you own an S&P 500 fund, check its top 10 holdings. You'll likely see Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, NVIDIA, Meta, and Tesla dominating the list.</p>
        <p>Add up what percentage those top holdings represent. If it's 30% or more, you're heavily concentrated in those names.</p>
        <p>Now look at your other accounts. Taxable brokerage? IRA? Add those holdings too. Many people discover they own the same seven stocks across multiple accounts, multiplying the concentration.</p>

        <h2>Thinking About Balance</h2>
        <p>Diversification isn't about avoiding risk. It's about spreading it so one bad bet doesn't sink you.</p>
        <p>If you're comfortable with your tech exposure and have time to recover from downturns, your current setup might be exactly right.</p>
        <p>If you're closer to needing the money, or if seeing a 20% tech drop would keep you up at night, exploring options that spread risk differently could help you sleep better.</p>

        <h2>Your Next Move</h2>
        <p><strong>Look at what you actually own.</strong> Most people can't list their top holdings from memory. Spend 10 minutes reviewing your accounts.</p>
        <p><strong>Understand your timeline.</strong> Concentration is more acceptable when you have decades to recover. Less acceptable when you're planning to use the money soon.</p>
        <p><strong>Ask about options in your 401(k).</strong> Many plans offer target-date funds, balanced funds, or sector options that automatically spread risk. Worth knowing what's available.</p>
