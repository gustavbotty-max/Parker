        <article>
            <p class="intro">It feels like just when you start to get ahead, something moves the goalposts. Fresh inflation data, new tariffs, and delayed rate cuts are doing exactly that—especially for families here in the Triangle.</p>
            
            <h2>The Numbers That Actually Matter</h2>
            <p>The Fed watches something called Core PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) to track inflation. Recently, it jumped 0.4% in a single month, pushing the annual rate back up to around 3.0%.</p>
            <p>That doesn't sound dramatic until you remember the Fed wants to see 2.0% before cutting rates. We're still a full percentage point away.</p>
            <p><strong>Translation:</strong> borrowing costs stay elevated. If you've got a variable-rate loan, an adjustable mortgage, or credit card debt, don't expect relief soon.</p>
            
            <h2>Tariffs Are Making Things Messier</h2>
            <p>On top of sticky inflation, new tariffs are kicking in on imported goods—often in the 10% to 15% range across a wide mix of products.</p>
            <p>Court challenges have created confusion about which tariffs will stick and which might be rolled back. That uncertainty makes it harder for businesses to set prices and for investors to decide where to put money.</p>
            <p>At the checkout line, that looks like this: electronics, clothing, certain foods, auto parts, and anything with overseas components could see price bumps in the coming months.</p>
            
            <h2>Why Rate Cuts Keep Getting Pushed Out</h2>
            <p>Earlier this year, a lot of analysts expected rate cuts by mid-2026. With inflation running hot and trade policy adding pressure, that outlook has shifted.</p>
            <p>Some forecasters now wonder if rates stay high through the end of the year—or even tick up slightly if inflation doesn't cool.</p>
            <p>For families carrying debt, this changes the math. That mortgage refinance you've been eyeing? The rate might not drop enough to justify the closing costs. That car loan you're planning? Budget for current rates, not hoped-for cuts.</p>
            
            <h2>Stagflation Worries: What If Growth Slows Too?</h2>
            <p>There's a term floating around in financial news: <strong>stagflation</strong>. It describes a situation where prices keep rising while the economy slows down. High inflation plus weak growth equals a tough environment for everyone.</p>
            <p>We're not there yet. But the combination of persistent inflation and uncertain trade policy has people paying attention.</p>
            <p>If stagflation takes hold, it creates a squeeze: your paycheck buys less while job growth slows. It's the worst of both worlds.</p>
            <p>The practical response? Don't panic, but do plan. Households that stay flexible weather these periods better than those locked into assumptions that don't play out.</p>
            
            <h2>What This Looks Like for Triangle Families</h2>
            <p>The Triangle's economy is diverse—tech, healthcare, education, and government jobs all help cushion local families from some national shocks. But even with a strong job market, you still buy groceries, fill up the car, and pay rent or a mortgage.</p>
            <p>When import costs rise and interest rates stay high, everyone feels it. Housing is the big one. Triangle home prices haven't dropped meaningfully, and mortgage rates near 7% make affordability tough.</p>
            <p>If you're waiting to buy, you might be waiting a while longer. If you already own with a low fixed rate, that locked-in mortgage starts to look like one of your best assets.</p>
            <p>For renters, higher borrowing costs for landlords often show up as higher rent at renewal. Build that possibility into your budget now instead of getting surprised later.</p>
            
            <h2>Your Next Moves: Practical, Not Panic</h2>
            <p><strong>1. Reassess your debt payoff timeline.</strong> If you've been making minimum payments expecting rates to drop, consider accelerating. High rates reward aggressive debt reduction. Every dollar you pay down on a 20% APR card saves you 20 cents per year in interest.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Build some buffer into your monthly budget.</strong> Price increases on everyday goods may hit faster than wage increases. Padding your grocery and household categories by 5% to 10% gives you breathing room without blowing up your whole plan.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Be cautious with rate-dependent decisions.</strong> Refinancing, major financed purchases, or anything that only makes sense at much lower rates might be worth delaying until the picture clears. If you can safely wait six months, you'll have better information.</p>
