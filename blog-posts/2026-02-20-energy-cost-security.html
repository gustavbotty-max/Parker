                <p>Your January electric bill probably got your attention. If you're a typical Duke Energy Progress customer using 1,000 kWh per month, it jumped from $163.84 to $186.95. That's $23.11 more every month, with another increase to $193.54 already scheduled for next year.</p>

                <p>Duke has also filed for additional rate adjustments in 2027 and 2028.</p>

                <p>This isn't a one-time spike. North Carolina electricity bills have climbed 22% since 2020, with state regulators projecting potential increases of 40-60% over the next 15 years as electricity demand grows and infrastructure requires investment.</p>

                <h2>The Real Talk: Energy as a Portfolio Line Item</h2>

                <h3>Understanding the Trajectory</h3>

                <p>Most families treat utilities as a fixed cost they can't influence. The reality is more nuanced. Duke Energy forecasts net load growth of 16-60% over the next 15 years—significantly higher than the 7% growth seen over the previous two decades. This suggests the rate increases we've seen may continue.</p>

                <p>The math matters for financial planning. If you were paying $150 per month in 2020, you're likely approaching $190-$200 now. That's $480-$600 more annually than three years ago, compounding yearly. Over a 10-year horizon, this becomes a meaningful line item in your household budget.</p>

                <h3>The Cash Flow Impact</h3>

                <p>Energy costs typically rank as the third-largest expense for middle-class families, behind housing and food. Unlike discretionary spending, heating and cooling are non-negotiable—particularly for families with young children, elderly members, or health considerations.</p>

                <p>When bills spike unpredictably (high summer AC usage, winter heating peaks), the ripple effects touch other financial priorities:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Emergency fund contributions may get deferred</li>
                    <li>Extra debt payments get paused</li>
                    <li>Retirement contributions get reduced or skipped</li>
                    <li>Credit card balances increase to bridge cash flow gaps</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Financial planning involves controlling what you can control. While you can't shop for a different electricity provider in Duke's service territory, you can treat energy costs as an optimizable expense—similar to how you might evaluate insurance, refinancing, or tax strategy.</p>

                <h2>What This Means for Triangle Families</h2>

                <h3>The Efficiency Multiplier Effect</h3>

                <p>Duke Energy uses a tiered rate structure: lower rates for baseline usage, higher rates as consumption increases. This means conservation and efficiency improvements can yield outsized returns. A 20% reduction in consumption might produce a 25-30% reduction in your bill because you spend more time in those lower-rate tiers.</p>

                <p>For a family paying $2,400 annually, a 25% reduction saves $600 per year. Over five years, that's $3,000—real money that can fund emergency savings, retirement contributions, or college accounts.</p>

                <h3>The Investment Case for Efficiency</h3>

                <p>Home energy improvements should be evaluated like any other investment: upfront cost, annual return, payback period, and risk-adjusted yield.</p>

                <p>The federal Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit offers 30% of costs, up to $1,200 annually through 2032. This effectively reduces your basis and improves your return calculation. For a family planning to stay in their home 5+ years, efficiency improvements often pay for themselves through reduced bills, then continue generating savings.</p>

                <p>Consider it similar to purchasing a bond that pays monthly dividends (lower bills) while also appreciating your home's value.</p>

                <h2>Your Next Move: Four Financial Strategies</h2>

                <h3>1. Eliminate Predictability Risk with Budget Billing</h3>

                <p>Duke Energy's budget billing program averages your annual consumption into 12 equal monthly payments. You pay more in mild months (spring/fall) and less in peak months (summer/winter), but your cash flow becomes predictable.</p>

                <p>For households living on tight margins or timing multiple financial goals, predictability has real value. You can plan contributions to retirement accounts, 529 plans, or debt payoff around a known utility cost rather than guessing whether next month will be $140 or $280.</p>

                <h3>2. Treat Efficiency Upgrades as Tax-Advantaged Investments</h3>

                <p>The Inflation Reduction Act extended energy efficiency tax credits through 2032. Here's the financial breakdown:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>30% federal tax credit</strong> on qualifying improvements</li>
                    <li><strong>Annual cap of $1,200</strong> (resets each tax year)</li>
                    <li><strong>Covered items:</strong> Insulation, efficient windows/doors, upgraded HVAC systems, heat pumps</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you spend $4,000 on insulation and air sealing improvements, you receive a $1,200 tax credit. Your actual cost is $2,800. If those improvements reduce annual energy costs by $400, your payback period is 7 years. After that, you're earning $400 annually in perpetuity (or until the next efficiency improvement).</p>

                <p>Compare that to current savings account yields, and it becomes an attractive use of capital.</p>

                <h3>3. Build a Utility Buffer for Cash Flow Management</h3>

                <p>Create a designated savings bucket holding 2-3 months of peak-season utility costs (roughly $500-$700 for most Triangle families). This isn't your emergency fund—it's a cash flow smoothing mechanism.</p>

                <p>When July or January arrives with a $300+ bill, you draw from this buffer rather than:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Carrying credit card debt at 18-24% APR</li>
                    <li>Skipping retirement contributions that trigger employer matches</li>
                    <li>Deferring extra principal payments on high-interest debt</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Treat it as a revolving facility. You draw in peak months, replenish in mild months.</p>

                <h3>4. Optimize Your Rate Plan</h3>

                <p>Duke Energy offers time-of-use rates that charge different rates depending on when you use electricity. If your household can shift discretionary usage (laundry, dishwashing, EV charging) to off-peak hours, you may achieve meaningful savings without reducing total consumption.</p>

                <p>This requires analysis of your specific usage patterns. Duke provides tools to compare your current plan against alternatives. The 15 minutes spent reviewing your options could yield ongoing savings.</p>

                <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

                <p>Rising energy costs are a financial reality for Triangle families. You can't control utility rate filings or infrastructure investment decisions, but you can control how you respond:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Smooth your cash flow</strong> with budget billing</li>
                    <li><strong>Earn 30% returns</strong> through federal tax credits on efficiency investments</li>
                    <li><strong>Build buffers</strong> to protect other financial priorities from seasonal volatility</li>
                    <li><strong>Optimize your rate plan</strong> to match your usage patterns</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Energy costs belong in your financial plan alongside mortgage rates, investment allocations, and tax strategy. With intentionality, you can turn a volatile expense into a predictable, optimizable line item—and redirect the savings toward building wealth instead of feeding the meter.</p>
