## Debt Payoff Calculator Updates

Completed multiple fixes to the debt payoff calculator:

1. **Snowball vs Avalanche Logic**: Fixed to properly sort by balance vs rate and roll minimum payments into next target debt

2. **Homeowner Section**: 
   - Shows when debt ≥$5K and has high interest (12%+) OR has a mortgage
   - LTV calculation with visual indicator (Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor)
   - Qualifies for HELOC if LTV ≤ 85%

3. **Payment Validation**:
   - For mortgages: Uses proper 30-year amortization formula ($300k @ 3% = ~$1,265/mo, not $3,750)
   - For other debts: Interest + 1% of balance as principal
   - Warnings if payment is <$25 of suggested minimum

4. **HELOC Display Fix**: Now shows HELOC option when homeowner qualifies even if current debts have low rates. Displays helpful message about cash-out refi potential when no immediate interest savings.

All changes pushed to GitHub Pages.
