Subject: Quick reminder — 21 Sources of Cash is coming up!

Hey [NAME],

Just wanted to drop you a quick note about the workshop next week.

By now you know the gist: we're walking through 21 practical ways to find money that's already there — just buried in places most people never think to look. Taxes, insurance, debt, bank accounts, and a bunch of other spots where cash tends to hide.

Here's what I'm hoping you'll walk away with:
• Specific ways to free up money in your monthly budget (could be $100, could be $500+ — varies for everyone)
• A clearer picture of how to tackle debt if that's on your radar
• Ideas for building up savings or investments without feeling like you're starting from zero
• That feeling of actually having a handle on where your money's going

This isn't theoretical. It's the kind of stuff you can look at the week after the workshop and start doing something about.

Also — seriously, bring questions. The whole point is for this to be useful for where you're actually at right now, not some generic advice that doesn't fit.

Looking forward to seeing you there.

Talk soon,

P.S. — If something comes up and you can't make it, just let me know. I'll send over the replay so you don't miss out.
